Lessons Learned:

Glossaries are very, very important. There were multiple times that our team became confused on naming conventions 
(ie Course Code, Course Number, etc.). That's when we turned to our glossary to settle all disputes. And, after
a while, the terms in our glossary became part of our team vocabulary.

In following Agile principles, we found it helpful to commit our goals for each iteration (also called Demo Dommitment).
It became our goal each and every week to see that all of our commits were met, all of those bite-sized commits eventually
culminating in our full-sized product.
