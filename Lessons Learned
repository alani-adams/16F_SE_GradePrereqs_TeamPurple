Lessons Learned:

Glossaries are very, very important. There were multiple times that our team became confused on naming conventions 
(ie Course Code, Course Number, etc.). That's when we turned to our glossary to settle all disputes. And, after
a while, the terms in our glossary became part of our team vocabulary.

In following Agile principles, we found it helpful to commit our goals for each iteration (also called Demo Commitment).
It became our goal each and every week to see that all of our commits were met, all of those bite-sized commits eventually
culminating in our full-sized product.

Data structures are definitely the way to go. Implementing existing data structures in java was extremely efficient in both 
time and stress. It was helpful because we did not have to worry about their accuracy or taking the time to create these structures.

Assigning roles as well as helping when needed was an Agile principle we implemented when working on this project. Agile discusses the 
blurring of roles in order to see the project succeed. This was evident in our team work because while we had roles, we were also
flexible and each willing to contribute to project in which ever area was needed in order to achieve success.
